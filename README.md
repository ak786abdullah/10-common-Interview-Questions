# SQL Interview Challenges: 10 Advanced Business Problems

## Project Overview
This project contains solutions to 10 common and advanced SQL interview questions often asked in Data Analyst interviews. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in complex data manipulation, window functions, and business logic implementation using MySQL.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
* **Window Functions:** Used  `DENSE_RANK()`, and `LAG()` for ranking salaries and calculating month-over-month growth.
* **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** specific use cases to break down complex logic (e.g., separating user login history).
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling duplicate records using Self-Joins.
* **Retention Analysis:** Calculating user retention rates using `DATEDIFF` and joins.
* **Rolling Metrics:** Implementing 7-day rolling averages for transaction analysis.

## Tools Used
* **Database:** MySQL
* **IDE:** MySQL Workbench

## How to Use
1.  Run the schema creation script to set up the dummy database (`A_Company`).
2.  Execute the queries sequentially to see the results for each business question.
